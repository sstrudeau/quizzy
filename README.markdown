# quizzy: a jQuery plugin

This is a super-simple mini-quiz plugin for jQuery. Currently allows you to load up a list of yes or no questions and get a result based on your "score" (one point per "yes"). A result can land in a range of scores. That's it.  

Included demo is from the book [Apartment Therapy: The Eight Step Home Cure]:http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553383124/?tag=apartmentth0a-20  which inspired this quick plugin.

Would be nice to have different question types, weights for different answers, etc. but didn't need that so didn't build it (yet).
